#  Wellnotes

*Wellnotes* is a decentralized platform for productivity and incentivized journaling, powered by Web3 and AI.

##  What is Wellnotes?

Journaling is one of the simplest tools for self-awareness and mental clarity — yet most people drop off within a few days. Wellnotes is designed to fix that.

We combine daily journaling, accountability groups, and on-chain incentives to make the habit of writing consistent and rewarding.
